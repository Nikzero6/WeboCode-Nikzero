### Theme: Furniture e-commerce website
The Basic Idea of this website is to give a Luxurious feel.  
And presenting the brand in an elegant, minimalistic and Impactful way.

## Pre-Processing Stage

- Used an image as a background image url for the main div and put upon a geryish film on it.
- Used fontawesome icons here.

#### featured section
- Used bootstrap grid and flex for making featured items with two columns one with image and other with content.

- Used the code from my Previous project [Tindog](https://github.com/Nikzero6/TinDog-Start-master) for saving time.
- Added extra background and box shadow to my Previous code.

#### Newsletter section
